		<p>It's 2 a.m. the Wednesday of Reading Week, and in your dark dorm room, lit only by the glare of your computer screen, doing anything but reading. A new message appears on the screen &ndash; "you up?" But it's not from bae, or even the booty call you found on Friendsy, it's your mom. You've been watching <em>Gilmore Girls</em> for the last five hours and haven't responded to any of her texts; she's worried about you.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>But fear not, now that Neilsen has run ratings on Netflix and other streaming sites like Amazon Prime and Hulu+, we can safely say that you're not alone in your viewing addiction. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported that <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-viewership-finally-gets-a-yardstick-1440630513" target="_blank">streaming syndicated reruns make up an increasing portion of revenue for media companies.</a>&nbsp;So, no, it's not that bad that all you want to do over your Thanksgiving or Winter Break is borrow in your bed and rewatch <em>The Office</em>. If this sounds like you (your reading week is more of a screening week and you don't call your parents enough) let NBN be your guide to all things bingeing. &nbsp; Whether you aim to Netflix and Chill alone, for the holidays, with a partner, with a friend or even if you're ready for a bigger commitment, we've got you covered. Happy streaming.&nbsp;</p> </div> </div>

		<h3>Drumsticks and Chill: What to binge over Thanksgiving Break</h3> 
		<h4>by Madeline Coe</h4>
	<div class="toggle prose">
		<p>We all know Thanksgiving Break is meant for spending time with family and eating delicious homemade food that you can&rsquo;t seem to get in Allison Dining Hall, but what are you really looking forward to on those four beautiful days of freedom? Netflix. And chilling. Alone.</p>
		<p>Forget about your rigorous class schedule, the stresses of finding a formal date and definitely forget about that time you accidentally locked yourself in the Elder staircase at odd hours of the night, because soon you will be homeward-bound to bask in the greatness of on-demand Internet streaming services with (basically) nothing to do. What better way to avoid the inevitably awkward encounters with relatives who have this constant obsession with your non-existent love life and dwindling career goals? The obvious answer is locking yourself in your room for four days straight with nothing but a turkey leg, some stuffing, obscene amounts of pumpkin pie and these Netflix recommendations by yours truly. Happy bingeing!&nbsp;</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3205802/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>How To Get Away With Murder</em>&nbsp;- Season One</a></p>
		<p>Currently raved about as one of the most thrilling television dramas, Viola Davis kills the silver screen with her brilliance in the courtroom and in the classroom. Davis&rsquo;s character, Annalise, is a criminal defense attorney who hand-picks a group of varied-personality law students to intern on her cases. The catch? They all end up deeply intertwined within a complicated murder investigation of a fellow classmate. This is basically asking to be a Netflix hotspot because it is cleverly written through flashbacks, giving you clues one piece at a time and consistently leaving you on the precipice of suspense (shoutout to Shonda Rhimes). You eventually think you have it all figured out, but the never ending plot twists continue to make this storyline to die for. Did I mention Shonda Rhimes? If I can&rsquo;t prove the absolute genius behind the twists and turns of this plot, check out this phenomenal trailer.&nbsp;</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1480684/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>The League</em>&nbsp;- Seasons 1-6</a></p>
		<p>If you&rsquo;re one of those people who think &ldquo;Thanksgiving&rdquo; is synonymous with &ldquo;football&rdquo; then this one is for you. Absolutely absurd in almost every single way, this fantasy football-obsessed group of friends (based in Chicago/Wilmette!) does everything, and I mean everything, in their power to win the league championship title and rights to yell &ldquo;Shivakamini Somakandarkram&rdquo; each year. Originally skeptical of the caliber of the plot and individual actors, I surprised myself by bingeing the entirety of six seasons on Netflix within one week. Each episode is only about 22 minutes long, so I&rsquo;m not lying when I say you get carried away pretty easily. A multitude of real NFL players hold cameos on the show, which adds an interesting dynamic to the already comedic interactions between the ridiculous cast. One of the main characters, Ruxin, is written as an elitist jerk of a lawyer who went to Northwestern &hellip; so make of that what you will.&nbsp;</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Lost</em>&nbsp;- Seasons 1-3</a></p>
		<p>Feeling lucky? Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t use the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42. When the survivors of a plane crash land on a mysterious island with hidden secrets, and even hidden people, things start to get weird. And by weird, I mean &ldquo;The Smoke Monster&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Others&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Dharma Initiative.&rdquo; Intrigued or confused? Either way, binge watching this is easy because it&rsquo;s told through flashbacks to keep you hooked and wanting more. Just not more than the first three seasons, because things start to get really out of hand &mdash; think underground bunker, metaphorical deaths and a high-stakes security system programmed within the island. Quite honestly, it&rsquo;s just not worth the confusion. Thanksgiving Break should be spent watching mindless television for pure entertainment, and the first three seasons of Lost can do just that.</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758745/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Friday Night Lights</em>&nbsp;- Seasons 1-5</a></p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Clear eyes, full hearts, can&rsquo;t lose. Well, that may not be the case for our own Wildcats, but we can still root endlessly for the fearless Dillon Panthers. While the &lsquo;cats are finishing up their eventful and roller coaster ride of a season and purple pride is surging within all our hearts in hopes of a decent bowl game, go back to the glory days of high school football with this star-studded cast of Friday Night Lights. Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton make a powerful couple that attempt to lead a disengaged football team to victory, but also help them grow into themselves along the way. It&rsquo;s a tearjerker, it&rsquo;s an epic drama and it has Tim Riggins &mdash; the epitome of a true Texas heartthrob. The Taylor family&rsquo;s intense emotional struggles are bound to keep you on the edge of your seat for five seasons straight, guaranteed.</p>

	<img src="christmas.jpg" alt=""> <h3>Netflix and Goodwill: Holiday movies to for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUjn3RpkcKY" target="_blank"> under the mistletoe</a></h3> <h4>by Katherine Reilly</h4>
	<div class="toggle prose">
		<p>It&rsquo;s winter break and you haven&rsquo;t seen your hometown bae since you left for school. You want to watch a holiday movie that may or not give you some romantic feels, while still keeping things casual. These flicks are perfect to watch while cuddling with your rekindled zip code lover.&nbsp;</p>
		<p><em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388419/" target="_blank">Christmas with the Kranks:</a></em></p><p>Nothing says &ldquo;Merry Christmas&rdquo; like Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis&rsquo;s characters deciding to do away with Christmas this year while their daughter goes to Peru for the Peace Corps. The Kranks&rsquo;s neighbors are not happy with the idea of the Kranks leaving Christmas behind to take a cruise to the Caribbean. After the Kranks have built up the courage to officially say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to Christmas, their daughter calls and says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming home for Christmas!&rdquo;&nbsp;The neighborhood then comes together to get the Kranks&rsquo;s house ready for Christmas before their daughter comes home. Funny, lighthearted and family oriented, this movie is easy to follow and easy to divert your attention elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047673/?ref_=nv_sr_1"><em>White Christmas</em></a></p><p>A holiday classic. For all the Broadway and Christmas lovers, this movie is a beautiful combination of the two. Set in 1944, two entertainers/World War II soldiers perform during the war for fellow soldiers. The rest of the movie focuses on what happens to them after the war with performing and romance. Bing Crosby stars in this classic movie and wishes that &ldquo;all your Christmases be white.&rdquo;</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1846442/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>12 Dates of Christmas</em></a></p><p>Similar to Groundhog Day, except set at Christmas. Great option if both you and your pal have seen Groundhog Day, so there&rsquo;s no pressure to pay attention. It originally premiered on ABC Family, so of course you can assume how it ends five minutes into watching the movie.</p>
		<p><em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337697/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank">The Prince and Me</a></em></p><p>Whether you want to find your prince or princess or not, this is a feel-good movie to dream about. It also takes place on a college campus, so it could totally happen at NU? The prince of Denmark decides to go to University of Wisconsin-Madison (sorry, Wildcats) and falls in love with a pre-med student, determined to focus on her studies and ignore boys (bold statement). A love story for everyone, this movie, whether &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; or not, is a great watch for any point over winter break.&nbsp;</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337563/?ref_=nv_sr_1"><em>13 Going on 30</em></a></p><p>The perfect movie to watch over the holidays with your childhood love. This movie will make you appreciate the precious time of being a kid that is quickly running away, so snuggle with your stuffed animal and remember how it felt to be a kid. Thirteen-year-old Jenna Rink wishes so badly to be &ldquo;30, flirty and thriving,&rdquo; and her dream comes true as she wakes up as her 30-year-old self, played by Jennifer Garner. She reconnects with her childhood best friend Matt, played by Mark Ruffalo, and discovers her future life isn&rsquo;t what she wanted it to be. A good movie to watch over the holidays to remember not to worry so much about your future.&nbsp;</p>

		<img src="online-streaming.jpg" alt=""> <h3>HBO/HuluPlus/AmazonPrime and Commitment</h3> <h4>by Claire Fahey</h4>
		<div class="toggle prose">
			<p>You just checked your calendar and it is already November, with Thanksgiving and winter break fast approaching. &nbsp;Where did the time go! Be honest, You know where the time went. You were Netflix and Chilling. You have now seen every episode of House of Cards and Orange is the New Black twice. You are currently so chill that you are practically an ice cube. While during the warmer months you reveled in your status as an aficionado of the Netflix and Chill lifestyle, after a quarter of college the prospect of going home and rewatching The Office seems a tad bleak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You, my friend, have moved into a new stage in your life. You are now ready for the more mature internet meme, HBOGO/Amazon Prime/Hulu Plus and Commitment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have done your time in the Netflix and Chill world and you deserve to treat yourself to a slightly higher form of streaming platform, maybe even with a consistent significant other who provides the funds for such endeavors. Here is a guide on what to spend your precious time on.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/?ref_=nv_sr_2" target="_blank"><em>Game of Thrones&nbsp;</em></a></p>
<p>Now as a Northwestern student, you definitely know about this show unless you live under a rock. This thrilling fantasy show is as long winded as The Wire but better suited for fans of Harry Potter. The show is centered around various noble houses fighting for the Iron Throne, the crown of the seven kingdoms. There is lots of manipulation, sex scenes, sword fights and even some dragons.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159206/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Sex and The City</em></a></p>

Be prepared for great clothes and heartbreak.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is only one season of Summer Height High but fear not, HBOGO also houses comedian Chris Lilley&rsquo;s two follow up series for the show. Finally you can get in on the jokes of a show that has a cult like following. Chris Lilley plays 3 characters in this ridiculous Australian high school mockumentary. Ja&rsquo;ime is a stuck up private school exchange student. Jonah is bad boy skater boi. Mr. G is the quirky director for performing arts, desperate for attention. Chris Lilley creates hilarious situations with his three main characters while the real-life students of the high school look on in shock.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Prime</strong></p>
<p>They hooked you with that free-two day shipping and then with the prospect endless current movies and tvshows to rent at your figure tips. With a $99 yearly fee, Amazon Prime is the holy matrimony of streaming relationships.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1606375/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Downton Abbey</em></a></p>
<p>Okay just indulge your mom already and watch Downton Abbey. She just wants something to talk about with you and it isn&rsquo;t even that boring. There are cool British accents and horses! Downton Abbey is set in the countryside of Britain in grand manor house. It follows the life of the aristocratic Crawley family in the early 20th century. You get to see how the family is affected by the World War One, the sinking of the Titanic and Ireland becoming a it&rsquo;s own country.

Jeffrey Tambor's prerformance has angered some people, garnered a great deal of support and took home a few Emmys and Golden Globes. Definitely worth a watch.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hulu Plus</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You got tired of only being able to watch episodes a week after they came out before they disappeared into the Hulu Plus only void. You decided to pay for the $7.99 a month to fight for your right to binge on more current TV to stay culturally relevant. (They also recently made a no commercial plan for $11.99 if you don&rsquo;t want to watch the same Suburb commercial twenty times throughout a 30 minute episode.)</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3228904/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank">Empire</a></em></p>
<p>Emfreakinpire. You watched one episode on whim and now you are hooked. You thought you would be the exception, you thought were better than Empire but no one is better than Empire.
