		<p>It's 2 a.m. the Wednesday of Reading Week, and you're sitting in your dark dorm room, lit only by the glare of your computer screen, doing anything but reading. A new message appears on your screen &ndash; "you up?" But it's not from bae, or even the booty call you found on Friendsy, it's your mom. You've been watching <em>Gilmore Girls</em> for the last five hours and haven't responded to any of her texts; she's worried about you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But fear not. Now that Nielsen has <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/27/9217403/nielsen-ratings-streaming-content-netflix-amazon-hulu" target="_blank">run ratings</a> on Netflix and other streaming sites like Amazon Prime and Hulu+, we can safely say you're not alone in your viewing addiction. We understand that all you want to do over break is&nbsp;burrow in bed and rewatch <em>The Office</em>. If this sounds like you (your reading week is more of a screening week and you don't call your parents enough), let NBN be your guide to all things binge. Whether you aim to Netflix and Chill alone, for the holidays, with a partner, with a friend or literally for all of break, we've got you covered. Happy streaming.&nbsp;</p> </div> </div>

		<h3>Drumsticks and Chill: What to binge over Thanksgiving Break</h3> 
		<h4>by Madeline Coe</h4>
	<div class="toggle prose">
		<p>Turkey, mashed potatoes, and four beautiful days of Netflix. And chilling. Alone. Forget about your rigorous class schedule, the stresses of finding a formal date and definitely about that time you accidentally locked yourself in the Elder staircase at odd hours of the night, because soon you will be (relatively) free to sit alone with these quick binges.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3205802/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>How To Get Away With Murder</em>&nbsp;- Season 1</a></p>
<p>Currently raved about as one of the most thrilling television dramas, Viola Davis kills the silver screen with her brilliance in the courtroom and the classroom. Davis&rsquo; character, Annalise, is a criminal defense attorney who hand-picks a group of varied-personality law students to intern on her cases. The catch? They all end up deeply intertwined within a complicated murder investigation of a fellow classmate. This is basically asking to be a Netflix hotspot because it is cleverly written through flashbacks, giving the audience clues one piece at a time and consistently leaving you on the precipice of suspense (shoutout to Shonda Rhimes). You eventually think you have it all figured out, but the never ending plot twists continue to make this storyline to die for. Did I mention Shonda Rhimes? If I can&rsquo;t prove the absolute genius behind the twists and turns of this plot, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkb-aBaxkVk" target="_blank">phenomenal trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1480684/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>The League</em>&nbsp;- Seasons 1-6</a></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re one of those people who thinks &ldquo;Thanksgiving&rdquo; is synonymous with &ldquo;football," then this one is for you. Absolutely absurd in almost every single way, this fantasy football-obsessed group of friends (based in Chicago/Wilmette!) does everything, and I mean everything, in their power to win the league championship title and rights to yell &ldquo;Shivakamini Somakandarkram&rdquo; each year. Originally skeptical of the caliber of the plot and individual actors, I surprised myself by bingeing the entirety of six seasons on Netflix within one week. Each episode is only about 22 minutes long, so I&rsquo;m not lying when I say you get carried away pretty easily. A multitude of real NFL players hold cameos on the show, which adds an interesting dynamic to the already comedic interactions between the ridiculous cast. One of the main characters, Ruxin, is written as an elitist jerk of a lawyer who went to Northwestern &hellip; so make of that what you will.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Lost</em>&nbsp;- Seasons 1-3</a></p>
<p>Feeling lucky? Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t use the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42. When the survivors of a plane crash land on a mysterious island with hidden secrets, and even hidden people, things start to get weird. And by weird, I mean &ldquo;The Smoke Monster,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Others,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Dharma Initiative.&rdquo; Intrigued or confused? Either way, binge watching this is easy because it&rsquo;s told through flashbacks to keep you hooked and wanting more. Just not more than the first three seasons, because things start to get really out of hand &mdash; think underground bunker, metaphorical deaths and a high-stakes security system programmed within the island. Quite honestly, it&rsquo;s just not worth the confusion. Thanksgiving Break should be spent watching mindless television for pure entertainment, and the first three seasons of Lost can do just that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758745/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Friday Night Lights</em>&nbsp;- Seasons 1-5</a></p>
<p>Clear eyes, full hearts, can&rsquo;t lose. While that might not be the case for our own Wildcats, we can still root endlessly for the fearless Dillon Panthers. While the &lsquo;Cats are finishing up their roller coaster ride of a season and purple pride is surging within all our hearts in hopes of a decent bowl game, go back to the glory days of high school football with the star-studded cast of Friday Night Lights. Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton make a powerful couple that attempt to lead a disengaged football team to victory, but also help them grow into themselves along the way. It&rsquo;s a tearjerker, it&rsquo;s an epic drama and it has Tim Riggins &ndash; the epitome of a true Texas heartthrob. The Taylor family&rsquo;s intense emotional struggles are bound to keep you on the edge of your seat for five seasons straight, guaranteed (season two gets a weird, but keep watching).</p>

	<img src="christmas.jpg" alt=""> <h3>Netflix and Goodwill: Holiday movies to for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUjn3RpkcKY" target="_blank"> under the mistletoe</a></h3> <h4>by Katherine Reilly</h4>
	<div class="toggle prose">
		<p>Winter break means finally reuniting with your hometown bae. You want to watch a holiday movie that may or not give you some romantic feels, while still keeping things casual. These flicks are perfect to watch while cuddling with your rekindled zip code lover.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388419/" target="_blank">Christmas with the Kranks:</a>&nbsp;</i>Nothing says &ldquo;Merry Christmas&rdquo; like Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis&rsquo;s characters deciding to do away with Christmas this year while their daughter goes to Peru for the Peace Corps. The neighbors are not happy with the idea of the Kranks leaving Christmas behind to take a cruise to the Caribbean. After the Kranks have built up the courage to officially say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to Christmas, their daughter calls and says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming home for Christmas!&rdquo;&nbsp;The neighborhood then comes together to get the Kranks&rsquo;s house ready for Christmas before their daughter comes home. Funny, lighthearted and family-oriented, this movie is easy to follow and easy to divert your attention elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047673/?ref_=nv_sr_1"><i>White Christmas: </i></a>A holiday classic. For all the Broadway and Christmas lovers, this movie is a beautiful combination of the two. Set in 1944, two entertainers and World War II soldiers perform during the war for fellow soldiers. The rest of the movie focuses on what happens to them after the war with performing and romance. Bing Crosby stars in this classic movie and wishes that &ldquo;all your Christmases be white.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1846442/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><i>12 Dates of Christmas: </i></a>Similar to <em>Groundhog Day</em>, except set at Christmas. Great option if both you and your pal have seen <em>Groundhog Day</em>, so there&rsquo;s no pressure to pay attention. It originally premiered on ABC Family, so of course you can assume how it ends five minutes into watching the movie.</p>
<p><i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337697/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank">The Prince and Me</a>: </i>Whether you want to find your prince (or princess) or not, this is a feel-good movie to dream about. It also takes place on a college campus, so it could totally happen at NU? The prince of Denmark decides to go to University of Wisconsin-Madison (sorry, Wildcats) and falls in love with a pre-med student, determined to focus on her studies and ignore boys (bold statement). A love story for everyone, this movie, whether "holiday" or not, is a great watch for any point over winter break.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337563/?ref_=nv_sr_1"><i>13 Going on 30: </i></a>The perfect movie to watch over the holidays with your childhood love. This movie will make you appreciate the precious time of being a kid that is quickly running away, so snuggle with your stuffed animal and remember how it felt to be a kid. Thirteen-year-old Jenna Rink wishes so badly to be &ldquo;30, flirty and thriving" that her dream comes true as she wakes up as her 30-year-old self, played by Jennifer Garner. She reconnects with her childhood best friend Matt, played by Mark Ruffalo, and discovers her future life isn&rsquo;t what she wanted it to be. A good movie to watch over the holidays to remember not to worry so much about your future.&nbsp;</p>

	<img src="online-streaming.jpg" alt=""> <h3>HBO/HuluPlus/AmazonPrime and Commitment</h3> <h4>by Claire Fahey</h4>
	<div class="toggle prose">
		<p>You have now seen every episode of <em>House of Cards</em> and <em>Orange is the New Black</em> twice. You are currently so chill that you are practically an ice cube. While during the warmer months you reveled in your status as an aficionado of the Netflix and Chill lifestyle, you realize you've moved on to a new stage in your life.</p>
<p>You, my friend, have moved into a new stage in your life. You are now ready for the more mature internet meme, HBO GO/Amazon Prime/Hulu Plus and Commitment. Here is a guide on what to spend your precious time on.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HBO GO</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306414/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>The Wire&nbsp;</em></a></p>
<p>The first day of your Urban Politics lecture, your professor mentioned <em>The Wire</em> and you shamefully had to Google what that was. Now you have access to all five seasons. This thrilling drama is all about corruption in Baltimore, from the police department to the education system. Each episode is about an hour long and chalked full of engrossing dialogue.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/?ref_=nv_sr_2" target="_blank"><em>Game of Thrones&nbsp;</em></a></p>
<p>As a Northwestern student, you definitely know about this show unless you live under a rock. The thrilling fantasy show is as long winded as <em>The Wire</em> but better suited for fans of <em>Harry Potter</em>. The show is centered around various noble houses fighting for the Iron Throne, the crown of the seven kingdoms. There is lots of manipulation, sex scenes, sword fights and even some dragons.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159206/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Sex and The City</em></a></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen one or two episodes of this show with your friends on late night TV. Now you can dive right into all of Carrie Bradshaw's antics and choose a side in the long debated question, Team Mr. Big or Team Aidan? &nbsp;Carrie Bradshaw is a sex columnist who documents the trials and tribulations of her and three fabulous friend's relationships in the Big Apple. Be prepared for great clothes and heartbreak.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0934320/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank">Summer Heights High</a>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>There is only one season of Summer Height High but fear not, HBO GO also houses comedian Chris Lilley&rsquo;s two follow up series for the show. Finally, you can get in on the jokes of a show that has a cult-like following. Chris Lilley plays three characters in this ridiculous Australian high school mockumentary. Ja&rsquo;ime King is a stuck up private school exchange student. Jonah is bad boy skater boi. Mr. G is the quirky director for performing arts, desperate for attention. Chris Lilley creates hilarious situations with his three main characters while the real-life students of the high school look on in shock.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Prime</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1606375/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Downton Abbey</em></a></p>
<p>Just indulge your mom already and watch <em>Downton Abbey</em>. She just wants something to talk about with you and it isn&rsquo;t even that boring. There are cool British accents and horses! <em>Downton Abbeyl</em>&nbsp;set in the countryside of Britain in a grand manor house, follows the life of the aristocratic Crawley family in the early 20th century. You get to see how the family is affected by the World War I, the sinking of the Titanic and Ireland becoming a its own country. In addition to historical drama, you see the three Crawley daughters relationship troubles (spoiler: one falls in love with the driver; scandal insues).</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3502262/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank">Transparent</a></em></p>
<p>This is an Amazon Prime exclusive show about a family who discovers that their father is transgender. All three siblings have a different reaction to thee announcement. Jeffrey Tambor's prerformance has angered some people, garnered a great deal of support and led to a few Emmys and Golden Globes. Definitely worth a watch.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hulu Plus</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3228904/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank">Empire</a></em></p>
<p>Emfreakinpire. You watched one episode on a whim and now are hooked. You thought you would be the exception, you thought were better than <em>Empire</em> but no one is better than <em>Empire</em>. Musical numbers, cheetah print, fur &ndash; this show has everything you could ever want and it's fraught with drama. <em>Empire</em> revolves around former rapper and drug dealer Lucious Lyon&rsquo;s hip-hop entertainment company. Lyon&rsquo;s three children and ex-wife Cookie are all trapped in a battle for control of the company and the fame and glory that comes with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2211129/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>The Mindy Project&nbsp;</em></a></p>
<p>The Mindy Project is one of the most clever current shows on television and is now a Hulu Plus exclusive after Fox made the mistake of dropping it. Mindy Kaling shines as gynecologist Mindy Lahiri who juggles work with her love life. Mindy wants nothing more than to be in the perfect relationship and open up her own practice, but encounters some bumps along the road. Also, Mindy&rsquo;s love interest Danny is played by Chris Messina, who is a QT so bonus points.</p>

	<h3>Netflix and Be Alone (Still)</h3> <h4>by Trevor Bohatch</h4>
	<div class="toggle prose">
		<p><strong>TV Shows</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439100/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Weeds</em></a></p>
<p>Based on a mother, Nancy, who gets into the marijuana business as a means of supporting herself and her two children, <em>Weeds</em> is the perfect bingeable show if you&rsquo;re looking for something with social commentary and wit &ndash; and sex. Lots of sex. Seriously, if you&rsquo;re just tryna chill, but not &ldquo;Netflix and Chill&rdquo; your partner might take it the wrong way, so it's best to watch alone. It&rsquo;s one of those shows that you are going to absolutely despise every character by the time you finish the series, but you just can&rsquo;t stop. SPOILER ALERT: What&rsquo;s even better is that everyone who Nancy does fornicate with either ends up dead or in jail.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3339966/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</em></a></p>
<p>The show that elicits those elusive exhaling-out-of-your-nose laughs. While it's not the funniest show on Netflix, it's also not filled with latent sociopolitical messages, so it&rsquo;s worth watching. If you&rsquo;re a fan of <em>30 Rock</em> you&rsquo;ll be a fan of this one &ndash; the show is created by Tina Fey and focuses on a woman who has been kidnapped for nearly the entirety of her adolescence and moves to New York City to experience something new. Poking fun at misogyny, the wasteful habits of elites and teen culture, Kimmy Schmidt will keep you laughing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086761/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</em></a></p>
<p>Perfect for when you&rsquo;re in the depth of a fit of self-loathing. Turn on the Kardashians, open up a pint of Ben and Jerry&rsquo;s and get under the covers because it&rsquo;s about to be LIT. And by lit I mean fairly mundane. &ldquo;There are people dying,&rdquo; you may say to yourself as you watch three fantastically wealthy sisters get into a fight over Kim&rsquo;s new Bentley, but trust me &ndash; you won&rsquo;t stop watching. See also <em>Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami</em> if you want to be thankful you&rsquo;re not in a relationship as dysfunctional as Kourtney and Scott&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Documentaries</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473181/" target="_blank"><em>Crossing the Line</em></a></p>
<p>An exploration of North Korea, but not in the way you might think. <em>Crossing the Line</em> focuses on James Dresnok, a former member of the army who defected to North Korea during the 1960s and has since become a model citizen of the People&rsquo;s Republic of North Korea. It could be easy to sit and hate Dresnok for betraying not only his own family, but also his entire country, but that's easier said than done. As he details deserting his country, lets the viewer into his failed marriage and introduces the viewer to the children that he has raised in the DPRK, one question remains &mdash; maybe North Korea not that bad of a place after all?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1486616/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank"><em>Craigslist Joe</em></a></p>
<p>A testament to human kindness and ingenuity, Joseph Garner commits himself to living off of nothing but Craigslist organized transportation, housing and food for a calendar month. He travels thousands of miles, and the people he meets along the way define his story. Filmed during the &ldquo;Great Recession,&rdquo; Garner effectively catches the pulse of a nation on the edge of financial meltdown while also taking into account sociopolitical realities (like the rebuilding of New Orleans) of the time. The film is also produced by Zach Galifianakis.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1158302/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank"><em>Oh, Saigon</em></a></p>
<p>Following the exploration of a Vietnamese-American woman into her family&rsquo;s own past, buckle up for an emotional ride. Doan Hoang and her family were on the last helicopter to leave the American Embassy the day that Saigon fell to North Vietnamese forces, but they left an entire part of their family behind. <em>Oh, Saigon</em> explores the impact a mother makes when she is forced to choose between her own children and a brother makes when he decides to turn his back on his own blood to further his own betterment. The emotional aftermath of events nearly forty years in the past lead Hoang back to her homeland to reopen wounds that some say shouldn&rsquo;t have been touched.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1859621/" target="_blank"><em>They Call it Myanmar: Lifting the Curtain</em></a></p>
<p>Show your crush how timely and politically adept you are with this exploration of Myanmar&rsquo;s (otherwise known as Burma) troubled past. Thought to be the second most secretive and isolated country in the world (only behind North Korea), get some background on what kind of dark and repressive military dictatorship the small Asian country appears to finally be coming out of. Includes interviews with long time human rights activist Aung San Suu Kyi who was put on house arrest for fifteen years as an attempt to quell pushes for democracy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1437235/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank"><em>Mugabe and the White African</em></a></p>
<p>Particularly interesting in context to the current state of race relations in the United States, this documentary follows a 75-year-old farmer in Zimbabwe who is under the threat of getting his land taken away &ndash; simply because he is white. &nbsp;Part of the Zimbabwean government&rsquo;s push towards redistributive policies dubbed &ldquo;Land Reform,&rdquo; Michael Campbell and his family are terrorized, physically beaten and dragged through a corrupt court system throughout their attempt to hang on to what is truly theirs.</p>
