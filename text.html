<p>It's 2 a.m. the Wednesday of Reading Week, and in your dark dorm room, lit only by the glare of your computer screen, doing anything but reading. A new message appears on the screen &ndash; "you up?" But it's not from bae, or even the booty call you found on Friendsy, it's your mom. You've been watching <em>Gilmore Girls</em> for the last five hours and haven't responded to any of her texts; she's worried about you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But fear not, now that Neilsen has run ratings on Netflix and other streaming sites like Amazon Prime and Hulu+, we can safely say that you're not alone in your viewing addiction. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported that <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-viewership-finally-gets-a-yardstick-1440630513" target="_blank">streaming syndicated reruns make up an increasing portion of revenue for media companies.</a>&nbsp;So, no, it's not that bad that all you want to do over your Thanksgiving or Winter Break is borrow in your bed and rewatch <em>The Office</em>. If this sounds like you (your reading week is more of a screening week and you don't call your parents enough) let NBN be your guide to all things bingeing. &nbsp; Whether you aim to Netflix and Chill alone, for the holidays, with a partner, with a friend or even if you're ready for a bigger commitment, we've got you covered. Happy streaming.&nbsp;</p>

	<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Drumsticks and Chill: What to binge over Thanksgiving Break (Madeline Coe)</strong></span></p>
<p>We all know Thanksgiving Break is meant for spending time with family and eating delicious homemade food that you can&rsquo;t seem to get in Allison Dining Hall, but what are you really looking forward to on those four beautiful days of freedom? Netflix. And chilling. Alone.</p>
<p>Forget about your rigorous class schedule, the stresses of finding a formal date and definitely forget about that time you accidentally locked yourself in the Elder staircase at odd hours of the night, because soon you will be homeward-bound to bask in the greatness of on-demand Internet streaming services with (basically) nothing to do. What better way to avoid the inevitably awkward encounters with relatives who have this constant obsession with your non-existent love life and dwindling career goals? The obvious answer is locking yourself in your room for four days straight with nothing but a turkey leg, some stuffing, obscene amounts of pumpkin pie and these Netflix recommendations by yours truly. Happy bingeing!&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3205802/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>How To Get Away With Murder</em>&nbsp;- Season One</a></p>
<p>Currently raved about as one of the most thrilling television dramas, Viola Davis kills the silver screen with her brilliance in the courtroom and in the classroom. Davis&rsquo;s character, Annalise, is a criminal defense attorney who hand-picks a group of varied-personality law students to intern on her cases. The catch? They all end up deeply intertwined within a complicated murder investigation of a fellow classmate. This is basically asking to be a Netflix hotspot because it is cleverly written through flashbacks, giving you clues one piece at a time and consistently leaving you on the precipice of suspense (shoutout to Shonda Rhimes). You eventually think you have it all figured out, but the never ending plot twists continue to make this storyline to die for. Did I mention Shonda Rhimes? If I can&rsquo;t prove the absolute genius behind the twists and turns of this plot, check out this phenomenal trailer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1480684/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>The League</em>&nbsp;- Seasons 1-6</a></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re one of those people who think &ldquo;Thanksgiving&rdquo; is synonymous with &ldquo;football&rdquo; then this one is for you. Absolutely absurd in almost every single way, this fantasy football-obsessed group of friends (based in Chicago/Wilmette!) does everything, and I mean everything, in their power to win the league championship title and rights to yell &ldquo;Shivakamini Somakandarkram&rdquo; each year. Originally skeptical of the caliber of the plot and individual actors, I surprised myself by bingeing the entirety of six seasons on Netflix within one week. Each episode is only about 22 minutes long, so I&rsquo;m not lying when I say you get carried away pretty easily. A multitude of real NFL players hold cameos on the show, which adds an interesting dynamic to the already comedic interactions between the ridiculous cast. One of the main characters, Ruxin, is written as an elitist jerk of a lawyer who went to Northwestern &hellip; so make of that what you will.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Lost</em>&nbsp;- Seasons 1-3</a></p>
<p>Feeling lucky? Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t use the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42. When the survivors of a plane crash land on a mysterious island with hidden secrets, and even hidden people, things start to get weird. And by weird, I mean &ldquo;The Smoke Monster&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Others&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Dharma Initiative.&rdquo; Intrigued or confused? Either way, binge watching this is easy because it&rsquo;s told through flashbacks to keep you hooked and wanting more. Just not more than the first three seasons, because things start to get really out of hand &mdash; think underground bunker, metaphorical deaths and a high-stakes security system programmed within the island. Quite honestly, it&rsquo;s just not worth the confusion. Thanksgiving Break should be spent watching mindless television for pure entertainment, and the first three seasons of Lost can do just that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758745/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Friday Night Lights</em>&nbsp;- Seasons 1-5</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Clear eyes, full hearts, can&rsquo;t lose. Well, that may not be the case for our own Wildcats, but we can still root endlessly for the fearless Dillon Panthers. While the &lsquo;cats are finishing up their eventful and roller coaster ride of a season and purple pride is surging within all our hearts in hopes of a decent bowl game, go back to the glory days of high school football with this star-studded cast of Friday Night Lights. Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton make a powerful couple that attempt to lead a disengaged football team to victory, but also help them grow into themselves along the way. It&rsquo;s a tearjerker, it&rsquo;s an epic drama and it has Tim Riggins &mdash; the epitome of a true Texas heartthrob. The Taylor family&rsquo;s intense emotional struggles are bound to keep you on the edge of your seat for five seasons straight, guaranteed.</p>

	<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Netflix and Goodwill: Holiday movies to for<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUjn3RpkcKY" target="_blank"> under the mistletoe</a> (Katherine Reilly)</strong></span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s winter break and you haven&rsquo;t seen your hometown bae since you left for school. You want to watch a holiday movie that may or not give you some romantic feels, while still keeping things casual. These flicks are perfect to watch while cuddling with your rekindled zip code lover.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388419/" target="_blank">Christmas with the Kranks:</a>&nbsp;</i>Nothing says &ldquo;Merry Christmas&rdquo; like Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis&rsquo;s characters deciding to do away with Christmas this year while their daughter goes to Peru for the Peace Corps. The Kranks&rsquo;s neighbors are not happy with the idea of the Kranks leaving Christmas behind to take a cruise to the Caribbean. After the Kranks have built up the courage to officially say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to Christmas, their daughter calls and says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming home for Christmas!&rdquo;&nbsp;The neighborhood then comes together to get the Kranks&rsquo;s house ready for Christmas before their daughter comes home. Funny, lighthearted and family oriented, this movie is easy to follow and easy to divert your attention elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047673/?ref_=nv_sr_1"><i>White Christmas: </i></a>A holiday classic. For all the Broadway and Christmas lovers, this movie is a beautiful combination of the two. Set in 1944, two entertainers/World War II soldiers perform during the war for fellow soldiers. The rest of the movie focuses on what happens to them after the war with performing and romance. Bing Crosby stars in this classic movie and wishes that &ldquo;all your Christmases be white.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1846442/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><i>12 Dates of Christmas: </i></a>Similar to Groundhog Day, except set at Christmas. Great option if both you and your pal have seen Groundhog Day, so there&rsquo;s no pressure to pay attention. It originally premiered on ABC Family, so of course you can assume how it ends five minutes into watching the movie.</p>
<p><i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337697/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank">The Prince and Me</a>: </i>Whether you want to find your prince or princess or not, this is a feel-good movie to dream about. It also takes place on a college campus, so it could totally happen at NU? The prince of Denmark decides to go to University of Wisconsin-Madison (sorry, Wildcats) and falls in love with a pre-med student, determined to focus on her studies and ignore boys (bold statement). A love story for everyone, this movie, whether &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; or not, is a great watch for any point over winter break.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337563/?ref_=nv_sr_1"><i>13 Going on 30: </i></a>The perfect movie to watch over the holidays with your childhood love. This movie will make you appreciate the precious time of being a kid that is quickly running away, so snuggle with your stuffed animal and remember how it felt to be a kid. Thirteen-year-old Jenna Rink wishes so badly to be &ldquo;30, flirty and thriving,&rdquo; and her dream comes true as she wakes up as her 30-year-old self, played by Jennifer Garner. She reconnects with her childhood best friend Matt, played by Mark Ruffalo, and discovers her future life isn&rsquo;t what she wanted it to be. A good movie to watch over the holidays to remember not to worry so much about your future.&nbsp;</p>

You were Netflix and Chilling. You have now seen every episode of House of Cards and Orange is the New Black twice. You are currently so chill that you are practically an ice cube. While during the warmer months you reveled in your status as an aficionado of the Netflix and Chill lifestyle, after a quarter of college the prospect of going home and rewatching The Office seems a tad bleak.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306414/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>The Wire&nbsp;</em></a></p>

Each episode being around an hour long and chalked full of engrossing dialogue.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/?ref_=nv_sr_2" target="_blank"><em>Game of Thrones&nbsp;</em></a></p>
<p>Now as a Northwestern student, you definitely know about this show unless you live under a rock. This thrilling fantasy show is as long winded as The Wire but better suited for fans of Harry Potter. The show is centered around various noble houses fighting for the Iron Throne, the crown of the seven kingdoms. There is lots of manipulation, sex scenes, sword fights and even some dragons.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159206/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Sex and The City</em></a></p>

<p>There is only one season of Summer Height High but fear not, HBOGO also houses comedian Chris Lilley&rsquo;s two follow up series for the show. Finally you can get in on the jokes of a show that has a cult like following. Chris Lilley plays 3 characters in this ridiculous Australian high school mockumentary. Ja&rsquo;ime is a stuck up private school exchange student. Jonah is bad boy skater boi. Mr. G is the quirky director for performing arts, desperate for attention. Chris Lilley creates hilarious situations with his three main characters while the real-life students of the high school look on in shock.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Prime</strong></p>
<p>They hooked you with that free-two day shipping and then with the prospect endless current movies and tvshows to rent at your figure tips. With a $99 yearly fee, Amazon Prime is the holy matrimony of streaming relationships.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1606375/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Downton Abbey</em></a></p>
<p>Okay just indulge your mom already and watch Downton Abbey. She just wants something to talk about with you and it isn&rsquo;t even that boring. There are cool British accents and horses! Downton Abbey is set in the countryside of Britain in grand manor house. It follows the life of the aristocratic Crawley family in the early 20th century. You get to see how the family is affected by the World War One, the sinking of the Titanic and Ireland becoming a it&rsquo;s own country.

<p>This is an Amazon Prime exclusive show about an older transgender women and her family. The family&rsquo;s life is changed forever when the three children find out that their father is transgender. All three siblings have a different reaction to their father&rsquo;s announcement. Jeffrey Tambor's prerformance has angered some people, garnered a great deal of support and took home a few Emmys and Golden Globes. Definitely worth a watch.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hulu Plus</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You got tired of only being able to watch episodes a week after they came out before they disappeared into the Hulu Plus only void. You decided to pay for the $7.99 a month to fight for your right to binge on more current TV to stay culturally relevant. (They also recently made a no commercial plan for $11.99 if you don&rsquo;t want to watch the same Suburb commercial twenty times throughout a 30 minute episode.)</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3228904/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank">Empire</a></em></p>
<p>Emfreakinpire. You watched one episode on whim and now you are hooked. You thought you would be the exception, you thought were better than Empire but no one is better than Empire.

	<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Netflix and Be Alone (Still) (Trevor Bohatch)&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>TV Shows</strong></p>
<p>The good, the bad and the ugly. If you&rsquo;re in for another night alone, check out this starter guide for some off-beat Netflix finds. These shows and documentaries are either completely cerebral or not all, either way perfect for binging. Though some of the TV series I have chosen to profile here are influenced by greater worldly missions, at face value they will all make you laugh.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439100/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Weeds</em></a></p>
<p>Based on a mother, Nancy, who gets into the marijuana business as a means of supporting herself and her two children, Weeds is the perfect binge-able show if you&rsquo;re looking for something with social commentary and wit &ndash; and sex. Lot&rsquo;s of sex. Seriously, if you&rsquo;re just tryna chill, but not &ldquo;Netflix and chill&rdquo; your partner might take it the wrong way, so best watch alone. It&rsquo;s one of those shows that you are going to absolutely despise every character by the time you finish the series, but you just can&rsquo;t stop. SPOILER ALERT: What&rsquo;s even better is that everyone who Nancy does fornicate with either ends up dead or in jail.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3339966/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</em></a></p>
<p>Elicits those elusive exhaling out of your nose laughs. Not the funniest show on Netflix, but not heavy and filled with latent sociopolitical messages, so therefore it&rsquo;s worth watching. If you&rsquo;re a fan of 30 Rock you&rsquo;ll be a fan of this one, it&rsquo;s created by Tina Fey and focuses on a woman who has been kidnapped for nearly the entirety of her adolescence and moves to New York City to experience something new. Poking fun at misogyny, the wasteful habits of elites and teen culture.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086761/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</em></a></p>
<p>Perfect for when you&rsquo;re in the depth of a fit of self-loathing. Turn on the Kardashians, open up a pint of Ben and Jerry&rsquo;s, and get under the covers because it&rsquo;s about to be LIT. And by lit I mean fairly mundane. &ldquo;There are people dying,&rdquo; you may say to yourself as you watch three fantastically wealthy sisters get into a fight over Kim&rsquo;s new Bentley, but trust me &ndash; you won&rsquo;t stop watching. See also <em>Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami</em> if you want to be thankful you&rsquo;re not in a relationship as dysfunctional as Kourtney and Scott&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Documentaries</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go watching any of these documentaries if you&rsquo;re trying to light a fire in your loins. But what they lack in humor is completely replaced by necessary and worthwhile explorations into the human experience. They&rsquo;ll light a fire in your heart &nbsp;or mind instead.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473181/" target="_blank"><em>Crossing the Line</em></a></p>
<p>An exploration of North Korea, but not in the way you might think. Crossing the Line focuses on James Dresnok, a former member of the US army who defected to North Korea during the 1960&rsquo;s and has since become a model citizen of the People&rsquo;s Republic of North Korea. While it could be easy to sit and hate Dresnok for betraying not only his own family, but also his entire country that is easier said than done. As he details deserting his country, lets the viewer in to his failed marriage, and introduces the viewer to the children that he has raised in the DPRK one question remains &mdash; maybe North Korea not that bad of a place after all?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1486616/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank"><em>Craigslist Joe</em></a></p>
<p>A testament to human kindness and ingenuity, Joseph Garner commits himself to living off of nothing but Craigslist organized transportation, housing, and food for a calendar month. He travels thousands of miles, and the people he meets along the way define his story. Filmed during the &ldquo;Great Recession&rdquo; Garner effectively catches the pulse of a nation on the edge of financial meltdown while also taking into account sociopolitical realities (like the rebuilding of New Orleans) of the time. The film is also produced by Zach Galifianakis.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1158302/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank"><em>Oh, Saigon</em></a></p>
<p>Following the exploration of a Vietnamese-American woman into her family&rsquo;s own past, buckle up for an emotional ride. Doan Hoang and her family were on the last helicopter to leave the American Embassy the day that Saigon fell to North Vietnamese forces, but they left an entire part of their family behind. Oh, Saigon explores the impact a mother makes when she is forced to choose between her own children and a brother makes when he decides to turn his back on his own blood to further his own betterment. The emotional aftermath of events nearly forty years in the past lead Hoang back to her homeland to reopen wounds that some say shouldn&rsquo;t have been touched.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1859621/" target="_blank"><em>They Call it Myanmar: Lifting the Curtain</em></a></p>
<p>Show your crush how timely and politically adept you are with this exploration of Myanmar&rsquo;s (otherwise known as Burma) troubled past. Thought to be the second most secretive and isolated country in the world (only behind North Korea), get some background on what kind of dark and repressive military dictatorship the small Asian country appears to finally be coming out of. Includes interviews with long time human rights activist Aan San Suu Kyi who was put on house arrest for fifteen years as an attempt to quell pushes for democracy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1437235/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank"><em>Mugabe and the White African</em></a></p>
<p>Particularly interesting in context to the current state of race relations in the United States, this documentary follows a 75-year-old farmer in Zimbabwe who is under the threat of getting his land taken away &ndash; simply because he is white. &nbsp;Part of the Zimbabwean government&rsquo;s push towards redistributive policies dubbed &ldquo;Land Reform,&rdquo; Michael Campbell and his family are terrorized, physically beaten, and dragged through a corrupt court system throughout their attempt to hang on to what is truly theirs.</p>
